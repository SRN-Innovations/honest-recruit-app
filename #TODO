add a messaging service within the app for employers and candidates to communicate directly through the app



Here’s a clean, practical status model and when each changes:
Pending: Candidate just applied. Created on “Apply Now”.
Under Review: Employer has opened the application or explicitly marked it as reviewing. Triggered by employer action (e.g., “Mark as Under Review” in Applicants page).
Shortlisted: Employer selects candidate for next step. Triggered by employer action (e.g., “Shortlist”).
Interview Scheduled: Employer schedules interview (date/time stored in application or a related table). Triggered when interview is created.
Interviewed: After interview concludes. Triggered by employer action (e.g., “Mark Interviewed”) or automatically when interview time passes + outcome recorded.
Offer Extended: Employer sends offer. Triggered by employer action.
Hired: Candidate accepts offer; onboarding begins. Triggered by employer action (e.g., “Mark Hired”) or by offer acceptance flow.
Rejected: Employer rejects at any stage. Triggered by employer action.
Withdrawn: Candidate withdraws their application. Triggered by candidate action.
